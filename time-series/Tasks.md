- [x] Check inference.py from sathvik to see about the node generation correctly
    - Doing 1 / the distance because we want shorter distance higher weight.
- [X] Change to do the transpose inside of the classes instead for the graph functions
- [ ] For all models try frequency and time domain
- [X] TGCN Fix
    - TGCN finally runs but it is pretty slow, and maybe there is an error because for now it is not good
- [ ] Maybe try the paper again after TGCN
- [X] See about using SMOTE for the dataset maybe
    - Already tried in the smote Resnet LSTM (it overfits since first 3 epochs)
- [X] Try frequencey domain on Resnet with LSTM
    - The Resnet with LSTM model (SMOTE) seems to overfit since the beggining using the frequency domain
- [ ] Try SMOTE LSTM bidirectional
- [X] Implement STGCN
