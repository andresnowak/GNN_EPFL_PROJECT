- The project is about Brain activity data (To predict if patient has a seizure or no from a 12 second window of the electrodes)
- There is a Kaggle competition for the project
- We can use our own computer resources and SCITAS
- Citations don't count to the 4 pages?
- We have to do a presentation of 10 minutes
- top 10 teams of the Kaggle competition will get bonus points
- The task is to classify if there is a seizure or not in a 12 second window
- One caveat no?, the majority of the data will have a 0 classification no (no seizure) so thi is something we have to consider for function losses like MSE (so to consider F1 scores, accuracy, precision and recall)
- We can use any type of models, But we do have to try GNN models and talk about those in the project, like why maybe they work or didn't work (but we do have to experiment with them).
- We will be provided with the pairwise distances of the electrodes and its position in the head.
- The Kaggle scores us on F1 score
- 5 times per group for tries each day
- We have to sign with group number name?

Dataset:
- The whole dataset is 150Gb or 105Gb?
- 5gb for training and 1gb for testing
- If it has 1 as label it had a seizure
- We have a session or multiple sessions? for each patient (97 patients)
- 12 seconds windows with 250hz polling rate
- We have 19 channels (electrodes no?)
- Around 13,000 windows (12 second windows)
