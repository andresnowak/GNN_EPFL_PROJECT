Hello everyone,

All of you should now have access to the academic purpose cluster Izar provided by the SCITAS team. You can connect to Izar using your GASPAR username and password with the following command:

ssh <username>@izar.hpc.epfl.ch

For more information, please visit this link. If you realize that you don't have access, please get in touch with me by email: sevda.ogut@epfl.ch

This link provides general information on how to submit jobs. You should make sure to pass the --account=ee-452 and --qos=ee-452 options when submitting jobs. If you encounter issues, please check the documentation first, and then contact us if your issue persists.

You can find the data for the project at /home/ogut/data once you connect to Izar.

Best of luck with the project!

The NML Team
